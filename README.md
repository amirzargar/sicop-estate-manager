**SICOP Estate Manager**
Enterprise Grade Estate and Industrial Unit Management System

**Summary for Recruiters**
SICOP Estate Manager is a production style enterprise web application built to manage industrial estates, unit holders, lease agreements, rent workflows, and compliance tracking for a government type organization.

This project demonstrates strong system design, clean architecture, real world domain modeling, and scalable engineering practices beyond basic CRUD applications.

It reflects how I approach software as a long term system rather than a short term demo.

**What This Project Demonstrates**

**System Design and Architecture**
Designed a Clean Architecture system with clear separation between domain, application, infrastructure, and UI
Built rich domain models that encapsulate real business logic instead of scattering rules across UI
Created single responsibility use cases to orchestrate workflows in a maintainable way

**Real World Business Modeling**
Modeled real operational entities such as Estates, Units, Leases, Rent Records, and Users
Implemented business rules including lease expiry detection, rent overdue logic, occupancy calculations, and permission policies
Designed audit logging and domain events to support accountability and traceability

**Enterprise Engineering Practices**
Strict TypeScript typing across all layers
Clear modular folder structure for scalability
DTO based persistence layer to support future backend and database migration
Event driven patterns for audit tracking and system transparency

**AI Integration with Production Discipline**
Integrated Google Gemini AI using structured application data
AI generates insights such as rent defaulters, expired leases, and estate performance summaries
Avoids hallucinated responses by routing AI through application use cases

**Product and UX Capabilities**
Built a dashboard showing estate occupancy, rent performance, and lease risk
Implemented role based access for Admin, Manager, Staff, and Unit Holders
Designed UI to remain presentation focused without embedding business logic

**Key Technical Stack**

Frontend
React, TypeScript, Vite

Architecture
Clean Architecture
Domain Driven Design principles
Single Responsibility Use Cases

AI
Google Gemini API

Storage
Mock JSON storage structured for migration to Supabase, Firebase, or SQL

Deployment Target
Vercel

**Representative Engineering Highlights**

Designed and implemented rich domain models for leases, rent, estates, and unit ownership
Separated business logic from UI to improve maintainability and testability
Built event based audit logging to track critical system actions
Created structured AI workflows that generate operational insights from system data
Designed the system for long term scalability rather than quick prototyping

**Why This Matters for Hiring**

This project demonstrates my ability to
Think in systems rather than only writing features
Design scalable architectures for real world complexity
Model business logic clearly and maintainably
Balance product requirements with engineering quality
Build enterprise style software suitable for long term growth
Integrate AI responsibly into production workflows

This reflects readiness for mid level to senior software engineering roles, especially in full stack, backend, and system oriented positions.

**How This Project Can Scale**

Replace mock storage with real backend and database
Add secure authentication with JWT and real user accounts
Enable document uploads for legal and lease records
Integrate payment gateways for automated rent collection
Deploy as a live SaaS product on Vercel
Expand analytics and reporting for executive dashboards
